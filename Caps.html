            <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and connect meaningfully with others.</p>

            <p>UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. <strong>This website is about CAPS.</strong> For information about UHS, please visit the <a href="https://uhs.umich.edu/">UHS website</a>.</p>
                
            <p>CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual services.</p>
                
            <p>Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.</p>
                
            <p>CAPS has a limited number of <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/private-counseling-rooms">private spaces</a> available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces.
                
                Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our <a href="https://caps.umich.edu/article/annual-reports">annual reports</a>.
                
                The CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone, which has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
